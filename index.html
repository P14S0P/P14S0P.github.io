                    <p class="prgraf">Financial success is not a hard science, it's a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Knowing what to do, tells you nothing about what happens in your head when you try to do it.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Money is everywhere, it affects all of us and confuses most of us.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">physics it's guided by laws, finance it's guided by people behaviors.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">History never repeat himself, man does.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Your personal experiences with money, make up maybe 0.000000001% of what's happened in the world,m but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">You know stuff about money that i don't and vice versa, we've had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">We all think we know how the world works but we only experienced a tiny silver of it.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">People should make investment decisions based on their goals and the characteristics of the investment options available to them at the time, but that's not what people do.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">The background of the presentation can automatically sell the product.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Put people in the frame of mind with the message so we can manage the person and send them to the product.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Whoever is seen as vocal is seen as cause.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">When you are afraid, you tend to go with a group, you will go with the message " a lot of people just like you, decided to do that".</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">People also like to be unique, the soul of the proyect, the first ones.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Different advertisments have different consecuences.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">People lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation, especially experiences early in their adult life.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and pluggin it into their unique mental model of how the world works.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Every financial decision a person makes, makes sense to them in that moment, and check the boxes they need to check.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Everyone talks about retirement but apparently only a few do something about it.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">We don't always do wath we are supposed to do with money.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in
                        life is guided by forces other than individual effort</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">If you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize that when judging
                        people’s financial success—both your own and others’—it’s never as good
                        or as bad as it seems.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down
                        upon and wish to avoid becoming.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf"> just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes can be attributed
                        to effort and decisions. </p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Risk and luck are doppelgangers.
                        Some people are born into families that encourage education; others are
                        against it. Some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of
                        entrepreneurship; others are born into war and destitution. I want you to be
                        successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not all success is due
                        to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when
                        judging people, including yourself</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more
                        on broad patterns.
                        </p>
                    <p class="prgraf">people who
                        have control over their time tend to be happier in life</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">You need to have sense of enough</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have
                        and don’t need.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">“Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—
                        will push you to the point of regret.
                        </p>
                    <p class="prgraf">There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential
                        gain.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Reputation is invaluable.
                        Freedom and independence are invaluable.
                        Family and friends are invaluable.
                        Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable.
                        Happiness is invaluable.
                        And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it’s time to stop
                        taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough.
                        </p>

                    <p class="prgraf">There are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, and sector bets. But
                        the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up And Wait.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns,
                        because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s
                        about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be
                        repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs
                        wild.
                        </p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Good investing is not necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently not screwing up</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Make people trust you and start focusing on the positive aspects of yourself before taking actions for a positive reaction</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Getting money is one thing.
                        Keeping it is another.

                    <p class="prgraf">We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into
                        tomorrow’s good fortune.

                    <p class="prgraf">The more you need specific elements of a plan to be true, the
                        more fragile your financial life becomes.</p>
                    <p class="prgraf">Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly
                        right in a situation that required things to be exactly right.</p>
                        <p class="prgraf"> optimism is a belief that the odds are in your favor, and
                            over time things will balance out to a good outcome even if what happens in

                        <p class="prgraf">You have 4 seconds to position yourself in the eyes of the potential buyer, people judge you on site. The buyer will rip you appart and put you together based on how you are perceived.</p>
                        <p class="prgraf">You have to be perceived as being: sharpest attack, enthusiastic as hell, expert in your field (we always search and defer for experts for help, when you let someone defers you it means they have control of you). </p>
                        <p class="prgraf">The customer must love the product at a very high level, the product has to make sense to them, they must trust and connect with you (the salesperson), they must trust and connect with the company, you have to lower their action threshold, and the last one, address any lack of pain(are they feeling in control or out of control) </p>
                        <p class="prgraf">Most of our attention goes to things that are huge, profitable, famous, or influential.</p>
                        <p class="prgraf">“It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once
                            said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you
                            lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a
                            fortune.
                             </p>
                        <p class="prgraf">The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say,
                            “I can do whatever I want today.” The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as
                            long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays.

                            <p class="prgraf"> When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy
                                driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people
                                would think I’m cool.” Subconscious or not, this is how people think.

                                spend lots of money on really nice things. But the way to be rich is to spend
                                money you have, and to not spend money you don’t have. It’s really that

                            <p class="prgraf"> When you define savings as the gap between your ego and your income you

                            <p class="prgraf">  If fevers are beneficial, why do we fight them so
                                universally?
                                I don’t think it’s complicated: Fevers hurt. And people don’t want to hurt.
                                That’s it.
                                A doctor’s goal is not just to cure disease. It’s to cure disease within the
                                confines of what’s reasonable and tolerable to the patient. Fevers can have
                                marginal benefits in fighting infection, but they hurt. And I go to the doctor
                                to stop hurting. I don’t care about double-blind studies when I’m shivering
                                under a blanket. If you have a pill that can make a fever stop, give it to me
                                now.
                                It may be rational to want a fever if you have an infection. But it’s not
                                reasonable.
                                That philosophy—aiming to be reasonable instead of rational—is one more
                                people should consider when making decisions with their money</p>

                            <p class="prgraf">But investing is not a hard science. It’s a massive group of people making
                                imperfect decisions with limited information about things that will have a
                                massive impact on their wellbeing, which can make even smart people
                                nervous, greedy and paranoid.

                                anyways. You have to give yourself room for error. You have to plan on
                                your plan not going according to plan.
                                 </p>
                            <p class="prgraf"> Leverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make your money
                                go further—pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin.
                                The danger is that rational optimism most of the time masks the odds of
                                ruin some of the time. The result is we systematically underestimate risk.
                                </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">The biggest single point of failure with money is a sole reliance on a

                                between what you think your expenses are and what they might be in the

                            <p class="prgraf"> Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and
                                forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong. Because it’s never as good
                                or as bad as it looks. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are
                                both real and hard to identify. Do so when judging both yourself and
                                others.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf"> Respect the power of luck and risk and you’ll have a better

                                better chance of finding the right role models.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and
                                your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by
                                suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or
                                more options in the future. No matter how much you earn, you will
                                never build wealth unless you can put a lid on how much fun you can
                                have with your money right now, today. </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. That’s
                                different from saying you should aim to earn the highest returns or
                                save a specific percentage of your income. Some people won’t sleep well
                                unless they’re earning the highest returns; others will only get a good
                                rest if they’re conservatively invested. To each their own. But the
                                foundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universal

                            <p class="prgraf">If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing
                                you can do is increase your time horizon. Time is the most powerful
                                force in investing. It makes little things grow big and big mistakes fade
                                away. It can’t neutralize luck and risk, but it pushes results closer
                                towards what people deserve.
                                </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Become OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the
                                time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things
                                account for the majority of outcomes. No matter what you’re doing
                                with your money you should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not
                                working. That’s just how the world is. So you should always measure
                                how you’ve done by looking at your full portfolio, rather than
                                individual investments. It is fine to have a large chunk of poor
                                investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case
                                scenario. Judging how you’ve done by focusing on individual
                                investments makes winners look more brilliant than they were, and
                                losers appear more regrettable than they should.</p>

                                But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re
                                more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than
                                horsepower and chrome.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s great to

                                what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding
                                magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge,

                                aren’t made with the intention of maximizing returns, but minimizing the
                                chance of disappointing a spouse or child. Those kinds of things are
                                difficult to summarize in charts or formulas, and they vary widely from

                            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Trading</h1>
                            <p class="prgraf">Don't confuse the day trading with another type of trading just because it has to be trading</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Day Trades don't mantain open positions for another day. Frequently all the operations that you manage, will be less worth in the next days.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">All the companies that you will use for day trading are to risky to keep the operations for more than 1 day.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">If necessarily you have to sell and accept the loose and be secure you don't have any operations after the market closes. Even if you loose.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">As a day trader, im trained to operate in a short term, searching for good operations for the day. Your time is measured in minutes and seconds, rarely in hours.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Buying in large, sell in short, day traders buy operations waiting for the prices of those to go up (Buying in Large) Buying in large it's good when you estimate the price will go up. What happens if the prices go down? In that case you can sell in short and in that way generate an utility.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Day traders can ask for actions to his broker, and sell them waiting for their price to go down, so they can buy them for a lower price to make profit. This is called selling short.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">When the price still going down, you still in dept in actions with your broker, it may will reflect like (-100 actions) in your account, it means you have to return those actions to the broker, the broker don't care about your money, the broker want a return of his actions </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">So if the price of this actions still going lower, you can buy them for a lower price than what you sell them for, and achieve an utility. Image that you ask your broker for 100 actions of Apple and sell them for $100 each, the price go down to $90 each, now you can buy 100 actions at $90, and return the actions to your broker, you will make profit of $10 per actionx 100 actions = $1000</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">What happens if the Apple action price goes to $110? In that case you still in bound to get 100 actions to return them to your broker, In that case you will have to buy 100 actions for $110 and you will loose $1000.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Short sellers benefits when the price of the title(action they asked for to sell) goes down, selling in short it's important because the prices of the actions tend to fall down more frequently, faster than going up.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Short sellers can have benefit from theirs skills meanwile other not expert traders, tend to fall in panic and sell their titles.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Selling in short has his risks, when you buy actions from a company in $5, the worst scenario is that the company goes broke and loose $5 per action, there's a limit of what you can loose, but if you sold in short a compnay for $5 and the price goes starts goin up and don't stop, then there will be no limit of what you can loose. Your broker need his actions, your broker can also suit you if you don't have enough funds to return your short sells.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Selling in short can be risky practice so, most of the traders tend to sell in large, they buy their actions waiting for the price to go up so they can sell them for more. </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Some strategies works only for selling in short: like the the strategy (Top Reversal)</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Your job as a trader is to concentrate in consistent and recongizable patterns that wins your confidence thanks to their performance in the past and put them in practice. </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">If the market or the prices of the actions are not moving a lot, you will probably not win a lot that day. Traders don't recognize the price of an action and they can't also operate it.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">As a day trader, you have to keep yourself in your territory, you don't have to operate actions that another day trader is not operating or watching. The force of the day trading focus on another day traders using your strategies. </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">The importannt part is to practice, be prepared, be disipline, play smart, not always you will win to the algorithms, but you can win against them some times. this takes experience, practice and good advice. </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">If you are not prepared you can be assure you will waste your money.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">There will be a bunch of stations that will go against the market, because they have a catalyst, those are the called (actions in game)THIS is what the independent traders are searching for. This bunch of stations that evolved meanwhile the market is going down or vice versa, if the market is going well and this stations too, there is no problem, just make sure you are operating with stations that are moving because they have a fundamental reason to move and not simply because they are following the general conditions of the market.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">the actions in game generally are object of new and unexpected news, good or bad ones, here are some examples: Financial reports, previous advices or warnings about results, surprises in the earnings, approval or denial of the FDA, US food and drug administration, fusions and adquisitions, alliances, societies, or important product releases, Important contracts, re estructures or changes in the management team, action divisions, split, self bought actions or debt offerings.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">When a sector shows wickness, it's not good for a reversal operation.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Always ask: This action is moving because the general market is moving or because it has a unique catalyzer?</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">When you become an experimented trader, you will notice the difference between an motivated action by a catalizer and one motivated by the general tendency of the market.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Instead of trying to find where the institutional traders are, find where the daily traders work and operate with them. focus where everyone else is focusing on. focus in the action that is moving all days, there's where day traders are looking for.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">How do you determine in which part the independent traders are looking for? There is a couple ways to find where's your best place. 1: Monitoring the Station's scanners that are used on day trading, the stations that show's a improvement upwards or downwards, those are the ones that the day traders are watching for. 2: It's good to be in contact with the social media and with a trader's community, stock tweets and tweets in general are good places to learn what is being tendency, if you follow a bunch of traders, you will be capable to see what everyone else is watching.  </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">As a day trader i don't operate based on a company's fundamentals, im not a long term inversionist, also i don't operate actions and futures, but i used the last ones to understand the general direction of the market in a future. </p>
                            <p class="prgraf">The majority of day traders don't operate penny's stocks, in the over-the-counter markets (OTC), the penny stocks are object of extreme manipulation and they don't follow any rule, we operate with real actions. But we are always buying and selling with stations that are having an exeptional day.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">There's always a day in the market that a company(station) is having a great day, because they revealed their profits, object of news or because something good or bad happen to them, this are the catalizers you have to search for.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Scan or do a pre market, at 6 AM (EDT) 4 AM (CR TIME), i try to search and identify where's volume in the market, as soon as 8:30 AM (EDT) 6:30 (CR Time) You can have an idea about which stations(Companies) will have positive or negative gaps, i start later to search in the news, the catalizers that could explain this type of gaps, i start making a list of observation, the list of stations that i will follow this day of trading, discard some and select the ones that i like and the ones that i don't, at 9:15 AM (EDT) 7:15 AM (CR TIME) im in the chat room, checking my list with my traders, at 9:30 AM (EDT) 7:30 (CR TIME) my plans are ready, since the market opens at 9:30 AM (EDT) 7:30AM (CR TIME) till 11:30 AM (EDT) 9:30AM (CR TIME) it's when the market will have the most operation volume and it's when the market is the most volatile, this is the right time to operate and focus on the momentum trading.</p>

                            <p class="prgraf">Accept the tiny looses so you don't have to expose yourself to a bigger ones.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">The success in the day trading is the result of a great risk management. A good pattern is a good opportunity to get into action with the lower risk posible. </p>

                            <p class="prgraf">You have to be able to find the actions that the day traders are operating.</p>
                            <p class="prgraf">Best trade of daily traders it's the low floating $10 or less being volatile, and the best strategy to work on this trade is the bull flag, only experts are able to make good trades and profit working on this trades, if an intermediate or low trader try to trade on this types of trades (low floating) will have a BIG posibility to loose all their money in the first days.</p>
